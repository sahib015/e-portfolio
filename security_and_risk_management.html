                                        Accoridng to (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019), industry 4.0 is referred as the 4th industrial revolution that moves from there and encompasses a range of technological drivers
                                        as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing that explores the decentralisation of communication between humans and machines. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An example of a real world of industry 4.0 is the Semi-Automated-Mason referred as SAM. This is a robot that builds walls, and it could potentially take over the construction 
                                        industry. The risk it provides is minimal as this increases the productivity and efficiency while reducing labour costs. However, it requires a human to configure the settings,
                                        this could be a risk defined as human error if the robot is misconfigured. (A few real-world examples of Industry 4.0 that are being used everyday!, 2022). 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another example is the production of cars. Car manufacturing factories such as Audi use large volumes of data that facilitate data driven, highly flexible and efficient manufacturing.
                                        As mentioned in the previous example of SAM, similarly the risks of a smart factory it reduces the labour costs resulting to unemployment. In addition to human factor of misconfiguring
                                        the machine prior of use, this could potentially cause a delay within the assembly process. Along with human factor in consideration, another risk is the type of data collected to ensure
                                        machines/robots are moving correctly. (A few real-world examples of Industry 4.0 that are being used everyday!, 2022).

                                        According to (What is Industry 4.0 and how does it work? | IBM, 2022), the article agrees with the article of (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019), that industry 4.0 is revolutionising 
                                        IoT in manufacturing companies.

                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Thank you for your submission on risk assessment in Industry 4.0 driven business models which I found very interesting. However, I do not agree that risks associated with Industry 4.0 systems are minimal. 
                                                    It is undeniably acceptable that every innovation attracts its own risks, which is equally applicable to Industry 4.0. The risks associated Industry 4.0 driven business models are enormous, 
                                                    complex and could be classified into 5 main groups. These are technical, competence, behavioural, data security and financial risks (Kovaitė & Stankevičienė, 2019). Behavioural risks 
                                                    can be further classified into 2, namely, risks related to staff competence (internal) and risks related to customers’ and partners’ attitude. Furthermore, it is worth noting that as the automation of 
                                                    technology systems increases, there is a need for new approaches to risk identification. This is more so that simply extending existing methodologies to Industry 4.0 systems could result in blindness to new risks. Hence, Nurse, Creese & Roure (2017) made the case for new methodologies to identify risks in Industry 4.0 powered business models. The position tallied with that of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) who recommended the Risk Assessment of Digitalisation of Business (RADi) model for risk assessment in Industry 4.0 driven businesses.

                                                    Thank you for your insightful post on automation of serving guests their meal via robots and Amazon’s delivery robot, Amazon Scout.

                                                    I agree with you regarding the robot waiter risks you have identified, however, this is in such cases that the control management system 
                                                    is down resulting to manual waiter service. In addition to the risk identified, while the control management system is up and running, there 
                                                    is the potential risk of privacy. As the sensors and camera feed data into an automated system, it may record sensitive data of employees and
                                                    customers. In order to ensure the restaurant is compliant with the data privacy act of its country, they should consult with an attorney who specialises 
                                                    in data privacy. (What risks restaurants should consider before deploying AI, robotics, and automation, 2022).

                                                    Thank you for your interesting post on digitalisation. As you have rightfolly mentioned about Alexa/ Echo app and similar devices such as Siri, and Google Home to enable 
                                                    individuals to control their electronic devices using the smart apps connected to devices such as Apple hub, Google Home, and Echo, what are the potential security risks 
                                                    that can this bring to the individual using these devices as part of the industry 4.0?

                                        In my <a href="#initialPost1">initial post</a>, I mentioned about what industry 4.0 is and examples of real life scenarios of how industry 4.0 can be used. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I would like to thank Daeman and Jonathon for their contribution to the post. I agree with Jonathon that industry 4.0 innovations do bring its own risks. As (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019)
                                        mention in their article, there are the 5 types of risks classified as Technical, Behavioural, Competence, Data Security and Financial.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As mentioned in my <a href="#initialPost1">initial post</a>, an example provided is the Semi-Automated-Manson (SAM), a vulnerability that is in danger of being tampered with is its data. The collected data is stored in a SQL database
                                        hosted in a database server.  (Robotic Masonry Is Helping to Fill the Skilled Labor Gap, 2022).  The data can be tampered with by using SQL injection.

                                    <p>
                                        In conclusion, from reading other colleagues posts, industry 4.0 is digitalising the technology world and incorporating devices with technology making our lives simpler and efficiently reducing the time spent on repeated 
                                        tasks with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud computing and big data.

                                        The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework that is used for the severity of security vulnerabilities in a software. This provides organisations 
                                        to provide a score to its IT vulnerabilities across a wide range of software’s. (What is the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)?, 2022).

                                    <p>
                                        (Spring et al., 2021), criticise characteristics of CVSS include robustness, unreliability and most importantly the CVSS formula does not have emphasis on the 
                                        scoring severity of the vulnerability.

                                        According to (Spring et al., 2021),CVSS is designed to identify the technical severities of the vulnerabilities and not on the risk of the vulnerability as people 
                                        assume to know about the CVSS scoring.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        (Spring et al., 2021), suggests that Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation is an alternative to CVSS.

                                                    Hi Sahib - a good summary but the core question here is: is CVSS a qualitative or quantitative measure? Do NOT rely on single sources OR throwaway definitions on 
                                                    blog posts - should we believe Spring et al or not? What is the evidence? Based on what you have read - what do YOU believe?

                                                    Hi Doug, 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Thanks for your sharing your thoughts. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The CVSS framework is grouped into 3 categories, base, temporal and environmental (IBM Documentation, 2022). The scoring of the 3 groups 
                                                    identified are relied on the scoring of the characteristics of the vulnerabilities. According to (IBM Documentation, 2022), there are assumptions 
                                                    and guidelines that are made in order to provide a CVSS score.  
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    As (Spring et al., 2021), mentions in their article, CVSS is designed to identify technical severities and not the risk of the vulnerabilities, however, 
                                                    according to (Tatar, 2022), assigning a range of values to a range of scores may easily demonstrate the severity of the vulnerability or threat.  
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    As there is contradiction on the CVSS scoring system, in my opinion, CVSS is a qualitative as this is subjective to the individual scoring the vulnerabilities of the threat.  
                                                </p>

                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This is a very insightful post.  
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    I would agree with you that CVSS is a qualitative risk assessment based on the subjective of the individual providing the scores of the assessment which impact the final score. In addition, according to Spring et al. (2021), the calculation formula has not been justified properly which affects the CIA triad of the system.
                                                     This, therefore, provides insufficient evidence that the formula is robust. 
                                                </p>
                                               
                                                <p>

                                                    Would you think that CVSS scores are limited to the severity of the technicality of the vulnerabilities instead of the risk of the vulnerability due to the lack of justification 
                                                    of the formula and the scoring being subjective?

                                        In my <a href="#initialPost2">initial post</a>, I outlined the characteristics which were outlined by the authors Spring et al. 2021. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        From the initial post, I received informative feedback from Doug. Following my response, CVSS scoring is a subjective analysis based on the individual skill set of the scorer. Therefore, it is a qualitative
                                        risk method that is based on a certain criterion (What is CVE and CVSS | Vulnerability Scoring Explained | Imperva, 2022). 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As the scoring for CVSS has not been transparent and the standardisation group has not justified the use of the CVSS formula, SSVC is therefore a preferred alternative (M. Spring et al., 2021). SSVC presents a risk 
                                        prioritisation method that may be useful to other risk management methods (M. Spring et al., 2021). 
                                    </p>

                                We were divided into groups by the tutor of the module to work on the assessments for this module. The assessments were conducted as a group
								sharing the tasks between the group. In particular I was involved in sheduling the meetings and preaparing the meeting minutes of all meetings held.
								As this was a group assessment,It is difficult for me to demonstrate my individual contribution pieces towards the assessment as we were working
								on a single document that was created and shared on a shared OneDrive folder which I created.
                            </p>

                                The meeting minutes we had as a group that I created at the end of every meeting held during the duration of the assessments have been consolidated
								into one document for ease of reference. The meeting minutes can be found <a href="Documents/Module03/Meeting_Minutes.pdf">here</a>.

												performance as the tool links the different phases during the project life cycle. There are several factors that may affect the use of the risk management<br>
												tools, some of these factors include:
												<ol>
													<li>Size of project in terms of the cost, duration, and resources. </li>
													<li>Skill level, training and experience of the project and risk management staff. </li>
													<li>Appropriate and accurate risk models </li>
													<li>The quality of data used </li>
													<li>Integration of risk management with project management practice</li>
												</ol>
                                                Their recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in projects include,
												<ol>
													<li>Have a structured interview approach with the risk personnel to understand specific issues</li>
													<li>Perform trials with software products to understand better</li>
													<li>Improve individuals risk management competence from training and exposure</li>

                                During the last twelve weeks, I learnt about security and risk management. This module covered various aspects about the security and risks that affect the 
                                IT industry and possible wates of mitigating the risks.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this module there were different activities that I was able to contribute in as part of a group and individually, such as the collaboration discussions, seminar activities, eportfolio 
                                activities and being able to work in a group for the assessments. The collaboration discussion topics were interesting and in particular I found the collaborative discission about CVSS 
                                more interesting than Industry 4.0. Prior to this module, I had only come across CVSS being a rating of a security threat. While contributing to the discussion forum, it broadened my 
                                knowledge regarding CVSS. While reading other colleagues posts in the forum, it made me understand that CVSS is not the only scoring method and additionally there are different factors 
                                to consider making it an unreliable source. The factors that make me feel that CVSS is an unreliable scoring criterion are (1) the CVSS formula, (2) there is no evidence that the formula 
                                is robust, (3) the CVSS formula is not transparent about how the formula is derived and (4) the skill set of the individual scoring the vulnerability. With these factors in consideration,
                                I think CVSS is more of a qualitative risk method instead of a quantitative risk method.

                                Working in a group for the assessment was an interesting experience as this allowed me to work with other colleagues in the course. While working on the assessments with my colleagues in 
                                different backgrounds, help me learn from them and gain some of their knowledge. As I am currently not working in an organisation and in at my previous workplace, the organisation’s main 
                                focus is on physical security, and I had the basic understanding of the different security threats from my bachelor’s degree. I learnt from them and would hopefully use what I learnt from 
                                them and during the course in the coming future.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The assessments of the module were challenging and interesting at the same time. With an organisation working to digitalise their business and begin the digitalisation process, there are different
                                factors to consider which was outline as part of the requirements. I found the assessment an exciting challenge ahead as to evaluate the potential security risks of the organisation may have as a 
                                group while digitalising their business and what aspects to consider during the digitalisation, such as the importance of having business continuity and a disaster recovery plan for any possible 
                                disruptions that may occur.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the instances while working as a group, we had a challenge in creating the analytical hierarchal process (AHP) for the assessment. As for a consistent AHP, the consistency ratio must be less
                                than 0.1 however we were getting a consistency ratio of greater than 0.1. At this stage, we were confused whether we got the calculations wrong and after further research, according to (Business 
                                Performance, 2019), we realised that it is okay to have the consistency ratio greater than 0.1. This meant that there could be inconsistency in the supply chain making room for areas to improve the 
                                consistency of a supply chain.  
                            </p>

                                As mentioned earlier, there were several tasks within this module that had individual activities. There was an individual activity regarding Monte Carlo simulation that had some exercises in excel. 
                                During this activity, there was some confusion I had on a particular question that was slightly misleading and contacted my tutor for assistance. With the discussion I had with the tutor, I was able 
                                to understand the scenario and clear the confusion I had, I was able to complete the activity. This can be found in the section  <a href="#risk_modelling">Risk Modelling Activities </a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In general, this module was very interesting and educative for me. At my previous workplace before I left the organisation, the organisation had a ransomware attack, and I was unable to mitigate 
                                this from happening due to the lack of knowledge and expertise despite working with another colleague managing the IT infrastructure of the organisation. At the time of the ransomware attack, 
                                there was no disaster recovery plan nor business continuity in place for such incidents apart from a data back-up that was not recent as it was about 2 months old. This module made me understand 
                                the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery plan for any organisation. As a result, the organisation had lost its data of about 2 months and the time it took to recover from the 
                                ransomware attack with a poor recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO).  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reflecting back to the time the organisation had the ransomware attack after this module, I have learnt that it is important to perform regular checks on policies, ensuring all standard regulations
                                are in place. Had I known how important business continuity and disaster recovery plan is, continuous risk analysis and performing security system checks, I would have been in a position to advise 
                                the head of the IT department on the implementation process of a disaster recovery plan. After this module, it has not only educated me on the security risks and ways to manage them but also the 
                                importance to educate others to create awareness on the potential security risks they may have as an organisation or as an individual. By creating awareness, this educates others who are unaware of 
                                the risks and how they could potentially reduce the security risks that they may encounter in the future in the digital world.
