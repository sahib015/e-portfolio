                                        Over the years, cybersecurity has been growing as an industry. The cyber risks have also increased over the years. In recent years, the growth
                                        of technology has accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic demonstrated the power of technology as organisations over the world 
                                        were introducing the work from home model. However, this exposed organisations vulnerabilities and unpreparedness (These are the top cybersecurity

                                        The digital world helps organisations and individuals connect with each other whereas, in developing countries, this creates opportunities to improve
                                        he technology in the sectors such as health (Cybersecurity risks are global. We must address them with a coordinated, collaborative approach, 2022).

                                        Cyber-attacks over the years have increased significantly and affect clients in various ways. With the different types of cyber-attacks such as phishing
                                        attacks, ransomware attacks, data breaches, cybersecurity has become a global issue as organisations and individuals have embraced themselves with technology.
                                        Individuals have embraced technology as part of their daily routine with smart devices that are connected via the internet, using financial methods to make
                                        payments on a regular basis such as Apple Pay, PayPal, among others.  On the other hand, companies have embraced technology by ensuring their software is up 
                                        to date with the latest versions available. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is important for companies to invest in cybersecurity as this will help the companies to mitigate the risk factor by having the right policies and procedures
                                        in place, be able to assess the level of risk at a given time and prioritise on areas that are of high risk in mitigating a cyber-attack in the organisation.

                                        In my initial post, I mentioned the growth if cybersecurity during the pandemic and exposure of the various vulnerabilities and the unpreparedness of organisations.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Thank you Shailender for your response. I agree with you that it’s the employee’s responsibility to ensure that their network is secure and bringing the security risks 
                                        into play outside the organisation. As rightfully stated, that it’s the IT administrator to ensure that the organisations network is secure however, there are some circumstances
                                        that employees would require to access the organisations via Virtual Private Network (VPN) to be able to access files. Organisations have deployed VPNs on their network to 
                                        enable employees to remotely access the organisations network.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Although organisations have deployed the use if VPNs there are some security concerns and problems to deploying VPNs. There are third party vendors that may follow the practices
                                        that are not optimal. (7 Common VPN Security Risks & Issues | SecureLink, 2022). Hence the choice of VPN should be chosen wisely by the IT administrator.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Prior to the pandemic, virtual platforms for meetings were not popular as not many people were aware of this mode of communication. During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses 
                                        began to get to know about various online platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meets, etc. Zoom of the one of many online platforms for virtual discussions, the number
                                        of users expediently grew from 10 million users to 300 million users during December 2019 to April 2020. (Zoom security issues: What's gone wrong and what's been fixed, 2022).  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The encryption was not end-end in which cyber-criminals too advantage of this vulnerability as Zoom were not expecting a substantial growth over a short period of time. As discussed 
                                        over the 3 units so far, there are countermeasures in place to mitigate the security risk. One of them being 2-Factor-Authentication which Zoom implemented to protect the user’s account.
                                        In addition, they improved the end-end encryption. (Zoom security issues: What's gone wrong and what's been fixed, 2022).

                                        In this module so far, I learnt that it is vital to ensure that there are policies and procedures in place to mitigate the security risk of potential threats and are regularly updated continuously.

                                        Data loss prevention also known as DLP ensures that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by any unauthorised personnel. (What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)? A Definition 
                                        of Data Loss Prevention, 2022). This technology is divided into two categories: Enterprise DLP and Integrated DLP. Integrated DLP is limited to email encryption, secure gateways used 
                                        for emails and secure web gateways while enterprise DLP are packaged for agent software’s specifically for desktops and servers, physical and virtual appliances for monitoring networks
                                        of an organisation and email traffic for data discovery. (What Is DLP and How Does It Work? | McAfee, 2022).

                                        This technology is involved in invoking alerts when unusual activities are found within the organisations network. This keeps a track of the logs while 
                                        protecting the organisations network security is not compromised in real time. (Technologies, 2022). There are several advantages of an organisation to

                                        In my initial post, I discussed the two security technologies, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Security Incident and Event Management System (SIEMS).

                                        Thank you, Kwok, Pearce, and Uvaraj, for your responses.

                                        I agree with Uvaraj that DLP is an important component of every organisation as data is the greatest asset every organisation has. As rightfully stated, 
                                        “Everyone in an organisation has a role to play ensuring the security of their data.” It is vital for everyone in the organisation to play their role as there are causes of data 
                                        leaks that can occur in an organisation. These causes may include insider threats, extrusion by attackers, and unintentional or negligent data exposure. (What is Data Loss Prevention

                                        Thank you, Pearce, for your contribution and for identifying that DLP is categorised into the following groups: Network DLP, Endpoint DLP, and Cloud DLP. In addition to these groups,
                                        I would like to add Email DLP as part of the DLP software tools. Email DLP is used to monitor and filter emails between users within an organisation and external users based on a 
                                        certain condition. (4 types of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) — Tricent, 2022).

                                        Thank you, Kwok, for your insightful post on Security Incident Management and Event Management Systems (SIEMS) drawback regarding the log correlation. I do agree with you that this 
                                        is a concern as SIEMS may provide false positives which may be misleading and cause a delay in response time in identifying the actual threat from the logs. Like firewalls require the
                                        correct initial configurations for optimum performance, a security incident and event management system also require the initial setup to reach its optimum performance while meeting the 
                                        requirements of the organisation and the purpose this system has for it in order to identify the potential threats in an effective manner. (Villanueva, 2022)
