										<h3>Group Work Assessments</h3>
											<p>We were divided into groups by the tutor of the module to work on the assessments for this module. The assessments were conducted as a group
												 <br>sharing the tasks between the group. In particular I was involved in sheduling the meetings and preaparing the meeting minutes of all meetings held.
												 <br> As this was a group assessment,It is difficult for me to demonstrate my individual contribution pieces towards the assessment as we were working
												 <br> on a single document that was created and shared on a shared OneDrive folder which I created.
											 </p>
                      	<p>The meeting minutes we had as a group that I created at the end of every meeting held during the duration of the assessments have been consolidated
													<br>into one document for ease of reference. The meeting minutes can be found <a href="Documents/Module03/Meeting_Minutes.pdf">here</a>.

													<h3>e-Portfolio Activity – GDPR Case Studies</h3>
													<p>
														 In this activity we were to read the website <a href="https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies">Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data
															Protection Commission</a>. <br>and provide answers to the following questions.

														 <ul>
																 <li>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</li>
																 <li>How was it resolved?</li>
																 <li>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</li>
														 </ul>
													</p>

											<p>
													For this activity I chose the case DATA BREACH AT AN ONLINE RETAILER (2016)
											</p>
											<p>
													From the case scenario, it was derived that personal data was stolen at the online retailer without the customers consent. This was resolved by the following:
													<ul>
															<li>Contracts are now in place to ensure the appropriate technical security</li>
															<li>Conducts regular reviews of server and website</li>
															<li>Conducts annual reviuews by 3rd party experts ensuring compliance and to independently validate that the appropriate technical security and organisational measures are in place</li>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
													The steps that I would have taken if this was my organisation and as an Information Secuirty Manager to mitigate this are:
													<ul>
															<li> Ensure a firewall is installed and configured correctly</li>
															<li> Daily and regular backup of data</li>
															<li>Ensure the payment gateway is secured</li>
															<li>Enable 2 factor authentication on the website</li>
															<li>Ensure and review the policies are up to date with the GDPR, ISO and PCI regular standards</li>

													<h3>e-Portfolio Activity – Quantitative Risk Modelling</h3>
													<p>Part A</p>

											<p>
													Read Goerlandt et al (2017), Hugo et al (2018) and Çelikbilek & Tüysüz (2020) and answer the following questions:
													<ul>
														<li>How do Goerlandt et al (2017) suggest that the validity of QRA approaches can be validated? What did they posit was the most effective approach?</li>
														<li>Which techniques did Hugo et al (2018) should be applied to project management? What were their recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in Projects?</li>
														<li>The last paper reviews various Multi-criteria decision methods (MCDMs) and considered the relative accuracy and validity of the techniques. <br>
															Which did they find was the most accurate of the methods compared? What were the failings of the general TOPSIS approach?</li>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
													How do Goerlandt et al (2017) suggest that the validity of QRA approaches can be validated? What did they posit was the most effective approach?
													<ul>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												Goerlandt et al (2017) suggests 3 approaches that the validity of QRA can be validated. These include, conceptional validity, validity in relation<br>
												 to different scientific foundations and pragmatic validity. The authors also suggested that for establishing pragmatic validity of risk analysis, <br>
												 the following approaches: complete benchmark exercise, partial benchmark exercise, reality check, independent review, and quality assurance.
												 <ul>
												 </ul>
											</p>
											<p>
													Which techniques did Hugo et al (2018) should be applied to project management? What were their recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in Projects?
													<ul>


													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												After reading Hugo et al (2018), the techniques should be applied to project management are risk management tools. These techniques assist in project <br>
												performance as the tool links the different phases during the project life cycle. There are several factors that may affect the use of the risk management<br>
												 tools, some of these factors include:
												<ul>
													<li>Size of project in terms of the cost, duration, and resources. </li>
													<li>Skill level, training and experience of the project and risk management staff. </li>
													<li>Appropriate and accurate risk models </li>
													<li>The quality of data used </li>
													<li>Integration of risk management with project management practice</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p>	Their recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in projects include,
												<ul>
													<li>Have a structured interview approach with the risk personnel to understand specific issues</li>
													<li>Perform trials with software products to understand better</li>
													<li>Improve individuals risk management competence from training and exposure</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>
												</ul>

											</p>
											<p>
												The last paper reviews various Multi-criteria decision methods (MCDMs) and considered the relative accuracy and validity of the techniques. <br>
													Which did they find was the most accurate of the methods compared? What were the failings of the general TOPSIS approach?
													<ul>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												Most accurate methods,
												<ul><li>AHP</li></ul>
												<ul></ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												Fallings of the general TOPSIS approach include,
												<ul>
													<li>The rank reversal phenomenon</li>
													<li>The ranking index </li>
													<li>The correlation between criteria</li>
												</ul>


												<ul></ul>
											</p>
											<p>Part B <ul></ul></p>
											<p>Read chapter 5 of the course text (Olsen & Desheng (2020)) and implement the inventory Monte Carlo simulation. You can use Yasai <br>
												Eckstein & Riedmuller, 2002) to replace crystal ball. (If you have difficulty implementing the course text model, there is a simplified <br>
												model also available).
												 <ul></ul>
											 </p>
											 <p>
												 I attempted implementing the inventory simulation and found it challanging. As I was attempting the simulation module with the guidelines <br>
												 from the chapter, I was unable to successfully run the simulation. I have attached my attempt on implementing the inventory simulation <a href="Documents/Module03/Inventory_Simulation_Model.pdf">here</a>.

													<p>Part A <ul></ul></p>

											<p>
												Read Opara-Martins et al (2014) and Morrow et al (2021) and answer the following questions:
													<ul>
														<li>What are some of the main vendor lock-in issues the authors identify? How would you mitigate them?</li>
														<li>What are some of the security concerns with the modern cloud? How can these be mitigated?</li>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
													What are some of the main vendor lock-in issues the authors identify? How would you mitigate them?
													<ul>
													</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												The main vendor issues the authors identify are:
												<ul>
													<li>Each provider develops its own specific technologies, remote APIs and some create new programming languages.</li>
													<li>Switching between incompatible software systems can force a customer to use the same products and services</li>
													<li>Applications are usually restricted to particular enterprises cloud or a cloud service provider. </li>
													<li>Businesses can face a lock-in situation making it difficult for them to change the service provider in the future</li>

												</ul>


												 <ul>
												 </ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												How would you mitigate them?
												<ul>
													<li>Build portable application</li>
													<li>Retain ownership of data</li>
													<li>Implement a multi-cloud strategy</li>
