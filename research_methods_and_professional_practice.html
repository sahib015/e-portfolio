                                        I have chosen to review the case, <a
                                            href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-dark-ux-patterns/">Dark

                                        for a UX designer it helps in designing a user-friendly interfacethat can be
                                        easily navigable by the end user.

                                        Dark user experience patterns are carefully designed to trick users into doing
                                        things without an understanding of human psychology. This raises a question-
                                        what is the user being tricked to do and with
                                        what motivation? The dark patterns were categorised to represent subversion of
                                        user centred design principles while some of these behaviours was a result of
                                        poor designs (Gray, et al., 2018).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The situation raises important questions related to the legal and social issues,
                                        as well as the professionalism of the UX designers in this case study. One of
                                        the legal issues in this case study is to
                                        deliberately mislead information or to discriminate against those with
                                        disabilities. This is where ethics come in and why it is vital for the UX
                                        designers to practice best practices and ensure all different
                                        types of users are catered for while designing the user interface for the end
                                        user. This has violated the BCS code of conduct section 1c which prohibits any
                                        discrimination with disabilities.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While this may have not been intentional, the policies and procedures should
                                        have been adhered to ensuring that their clients' designs are not deceptive or
                                        harmful to its users. Unfortunately, the outcome
                                        was such that there was a breach of ethics code principles as well as the BCS
                                        code of conduct.

                                            <p>
                                                thanks for the opportunity to review this case with you. I find it
                                                intriguing that this kind of practices is still happening. What makes me
                                                curious is if people who employ such tactics do get fined or imprisoned
                                                or punished in any way defined by the relevant law. For example, Mark
                                                Zuckerberg has "his own" dark UX pattern named after him (UXPin, 2023).
                                                It does appear however, that he was never personally held accountable,
                                                in any meaningful way, for the wrongdoing of Facebook (Goodwin, B. et
                                                al., 2019).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It is great, however, to see the actions of government bodies, such as
                                                Federal Trade Commission in the US, which acknowledge how harmful this
                                                practice is and implement fines, investigations and other efforts in
                                                order to limi dar UX patterns occurring (Ritchie et al., 2022).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Lastly, thank you very much for sharing the study on the dark UX
                                                patterns (Gray et al., 2018) which I found interesting to read. I wonder
                                                if you have any examples from your life that come to mind, where you
                                                experienced some of the dark UX design patterns?
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                For me it was a Polish website similar to Amazon (in function,
                                                definitely not in scale) called Allegro.pl (Allegro.pl). They have
                                                changed this right now, so I am unable to prove or to reference any
                                                source, but I remember from my personal experience, when they would ask
                                                to join their membership club for a fee. In the pop-up window there was
                                                no yes/no option, but either "Yes I want to join" or "No, I want to miss
                                                on a great deal" option. This particular pattern appears to use the
                                                cognitive dissonance theory, which quite clearly states, that if we want
                                                to take an action (click the "[...] miss on a great deal" button) that
                                                is conflicting with our believes (I surely do not want to miss on great
                                                deals, I just do not find this one to be a great one), it puts a strain
                                                on our nervous system (Harmon-Jones, E. et al., 2019).

                                                The usage of dark UX Patterns for manipulation, may be just an evolution
                                                of selling behaviour, that was previously seen in traditional
                                                brick-and-mortar stores personally.
                                                Examples would be where the Cashier desks are positioned at the back of
                                                the store, so you need to walk past most of the store to pay for any
                                                items you want to purchase, or the layout of Ikea Home furnishing Stores
                                                in Europe, where they would like you to follow the arrows around the
                                                complete store, regardless of what you are looking to purchase, or even
                                                “3 for 2” on some items, to fool you into thinking that the shop is
                                                cheaper, but other goods are more expensive than the competitors to even
                                                out the “offers”.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                A study (Alawadhi et al, 2016) confirms that store layout and a
                                                perception of it being busy or crowded, help to reinforce to the shopper
                                                that it must be worth the effort to shop there. This modelling shows
                                                that manipulation as part of the buying experience is nothing new.
                                                Perhaps people in general, are far more easily manipulated than we would
                                                like to think.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The recent increase in online shopping practices changes the game a bit
                                                though.
                                                From an online shopping site perspective, and using an understanding of
                                                human psychology, a web page is designed to appeal more through whatever
                                                means – colours, shapes, Lay-out, etc, in order to try and convince the
                                                shopper to purchase more of the items.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The same practices used in real shops, are copied online, but with much
                                                more simplicity.
                                                Gray states (Gray et al, 2021) “We also rely upon recent work that
                                                describes the role of crafty psychological nudging through the
                                                incorporation of “dark patterns” and instances where coercion is
                                                blatantly described in ways that often force users to make decisions
                                                against their own best interest—what Gray and colleagues describe as
                                                “asshole designs””.Ì
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                What is also interesting in their study, is that their results show that
                                                a very high percentage of users (over 80%) mistrust smartphone
                                                applications or websites, at least some of the time, and not just
                                                related to shopping experiences.
                                                This “non-default-trust” perception is not surprising, as I am sure we
                                                have all seen websites with offers for things that just seem to be too
                                                good to be true.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I think your conclusion is very interesting, as the usage of dark UX can
                                                certainly be called dishonest or unethical, and it certainly breaks a
                                                number of the BCS principles along the way.
                                                I think that it could be difficult however, to easily change the laws to
                                                prevent this, though the EU-GDPR is going some way to try and address
                                                this for member states, and have published “guidelines” to web designers
                                                as well as users, to be able to recognise and avoid using Dark UX
                                                patterns (EDPB, 2022).

                                                The post and summary provide a good overview of dark UX patterns and the
                                                legal and ethical issues surrounding them. You have correctly identified
                                                that dark UX patterns are designed to trick users into doing things they
                                                would not otherwise do, and that they can have a negative impact on
                                                users, including those with disabilities.

                                                You also raised important questions about the professionalism of UX
                                                designers who use dark UX patterns. UX designers have a responsibility
                                                to design user interfaces that are ethical and accessible to all users.
                                                The use of dark UX patterns violates this responsibility and can damage
                                                the reputation of the UX designer and their employer. (bcs.org, 2022)

                                                You concluded by stating that the policies and procedures of the UX
                                                designers in the case study should have been adhered to in order to
                                                ensure that their clients' designs were not deceptive or harmful to
                                                users. Unfortunately, this was not done, and as a result, there was a
                                                breach of ethics code principles as well as the BCS code of conduct. I
                                                would like to ask what are the challenges of avoiding dark UX patterns
                                                for developers.

                                                raised important questions about the professionalism of UX designers who

                                                    It is indeed disappointing to see this kind of behaviour in
                                                    workplaces be a problem and damaging impact on the organisation.

                                                    With the moral of Diane being negatively impacted along with a toxic
                                                    working environment as mentioned in your post, I would like to add
                                                    on the social impact where employees like Diane would feel low in
                                                    confidence and their level of productivity decreases such as
                                                    procrastinating, taking longer breaks or leaving their workplace
                                                    early (Ahmad & Omar, 2013).
                                                    While Max’s behaviour clearly violated several principles outlined
                                                    in your post, his power was indeed an abuse of power being the team
                                                    leader. I feel that despite being a team leader, it is important to
                                                    consider and appreciate your team’s efforts and acknowledge the team
                                                    member's contribution instead of authorship. Appreciating and
                                                    acknowledging the team’s effort boosts the morale of the team and
                                                    motivates them to perform better and impact the organisation
                                                    positively.

                                                    Considering that Corazon has worked with charities providing
                                                    healthcare services for individuals below the poverty line to ensure
                                                    that they have access to healthcare. It has indeed impacted society
                                                    in a positive manner that can be used as motivation for other
                                                    healthcare organisations and Corazon to continue making a difference
                                                    in society.

                                                    As Corazon continues to grow, it would be interesting to see how it
                                                    would ensure the protection of patient records is kept secure. I

                                    Thanks for the review comments on my initial post.

                                    A study was conducted on the Facebook interface over the years. For instance, the
                                    “Logout Button” was at the top of the navigation bar, and since 2010, the position
                                    of the logout button moved to the accounts section. (Mildner & Savino, 2021). UX
                                    designs are meant to allow the end user to navigate through the interface with ease
                                    and should generally be self-intuitive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, Facebook introduced a feature called “Privacy check-up (Mildner &
                                    Savino, 2021) that allows users to edit their privacy settings according to their
                                    preferences. As part of the dark UX patterns, the complete range of settings is not
                                    available, and this is where the user is being tricked as I mentioned in my initial
                                    post dark user experience patterns are carefully designed to trick users. This plays
                                    in the mind of the user that the complete range of settings are available however,
                                    unknowingly Facebook is holding some privacy settings that are not visible to the
                                    user and therefore the users are unaware of them. This would therefore be considered
                                    unethical and against the BCS code of conduct and ACM code of ethics.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In my opinion, the challenges I foresee a developer may have on how to develop
                                    within the code of ethics is omitting any hidden costs during an online checkout or
                                    ensuring that the correct link is displayed when clicked instead of a different
                                    action being performed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In summary, it is important that as a user interface designer to ensure that the
                                    users are not being tricked and are considering the code of ethics while developing
                                    the user interfaces of the software.

                                Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received
                                a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz.
                                Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses
                                and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi
                                has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they
                                may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz
                                in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support
                                either side of any issue.”

                                <li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically.
                                    But is
                                    it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports
                                    two
                                    or more different conclusions?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?

                                <li>
                                    If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that
                                    they
                                    will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?
                                </li>

                            </ol>

                                <p>
                                    Having collected the necessary data, Abi should not manipulate the data to support a
                                    biased conclusion as this would be considered fraud. If Abi shares his findings that
                                    are biased and focuses on his conclusion of the analysis in a particular direction
                                    while omitting important information is unethical as this can mislead the buyer of
                                    the cereal (The National Academies Press, 2009).

                                    Statistics during an analysis have an impact on the analysis when appropriately
                                    used. According to (Grilli, et al., 2023), there are tools and techniques for
                                    handling data that would allow data professionals like Abi to extract necessary
                                    information to provide insights. However, when statistics are used inappropriately,
                                    results can be tampered with leaving important information and misleading the buyer.
                                    Therefore, it is important that Abi is transparent and unbiased as this would ensure
                                    he completes the analysis ethically.

                                    AAccording to (Simundic, 2013) it is dishonest and unethical to conduct biased
                                    research, and therefore, Abi should include the ethical concerns he has in his
                                    analysis.

                                                Thanks for your entry. Do you have some examples of a local legislation
                                                which would indicate the kind of penalties for committing mentioned
                                                fraud? It would be interesting to learn a bit more about that.

                                                Your point about statistics having an impact on the analysis is very
                                                accurate.
                                                False use of statistics could be potentially damaging to the consumer in
                                                this case, as the cereal would potentially be marketed as a healthy
                                                option, but the truth may in fact be something different.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                The statistics could be used as part of an advertising campaign, but it
                                                would essentially be using false and misleading information, if not all
                                                known factors are considered. It has been shown (Madhavi, 2020) that
                                                “misleading and false advertisements have had an impact on consumer
                                                behavior”.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Whilst in some cases this may be just unethical, in situations like the
                                                one with Whizzz Cereal, it could have potentially long lasting health
                                                implications for the consumer.

                                                Thank you Piotor for your response. In regard to the legislation that is
                                                punishable for committing any kind of fraud. In Abi’s case, it is
                                                manipulation of data. Under the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act 2018
                                                in Kenya, section 26, it is punishable by law for any fraudulent or
                                                dishonest intent is an offense and is liable to a fine not exceeding Ksh
                                                20,000,000/- (approx. £104,920.78) or a term in prison not exceeding 10

                                                I agree with you that Abi is entirely responsible for conducting the
                                                research and is held responsible. Additionally, defining the methodology
                                                in advance as early as the initial stages of the research can provide a
                                                clear layout of the research.

                                                In your initial post, you mentioned that Abi would face several ethical
                                                dilemmas. I would like to add to that with a couple of ethical concerns.

                                                Hi Pearce,
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In your post, you mentioned that nutritional research is an issue with
                                                companies promoting false claims. It is important for Abi to be aware of
                                                and account for numerous food-related issues when collecting data such
                                                as the different varieties Whizz may have. Another factor that Abi would
                                                need to consider is people's BMI, food preferences, metabolic rate, and
                                                fitness levels, among others (Vitolins & Case, 2020). While gathering
                                                the relevant data it is important that Abi maintains ethical integrity
                                                and confidentiality ensuring the data is as accurate as possible.
                                            </p>

                                    In my <a href="#initialPost2">initial post</a>, I looked at the ethics and how
                                    statistics have an impact during an analysis. I however noticed that I did not
                                    include legislation and would like to thank Piotr for pointing this out.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As I mentioned in the peer response, the legal aspect in Kenya has an Act (Republic
                                    of Kenya, 2018) for any fraudulent or dishonest intent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Providing false reports for data analysis knowingly is unethical and therefore it is
                                    important that Abi does not manipulate the data to favour one side as there would be
                                    legal consequence that can occur (Stahl, et al., 2016)

                                        scientific methods (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020). In this unit, I learnt about
                                        the important types of reasoning and reasons on why to conduct research
                                        (Question Pro, 2021).

                                        Unit 02 focused on writing a literature review. Dawson (2015) did provide me
                                        with great insights on how to write a literature review as I have not created a
                                        literature review before. In this unit, I started looking at the research topic
                                        to consider for my literature review using the questions available to guide me
                                        through the content of the literature review in an outline form ensuring that I
                                        cover the required details of a literature review.

                                        In unit 03 we looked into understanding the different research designs and how
                                        to conduct the research (Saunders et al., 2012). From this unit, I learnt that
                                        there are 2 types of research designs (1) exploratory research and (2)
                                        conclusive research. Additionally, there are 3 main research methods widely used
                                        during research: (1) qualitative, (2) quantitative and, (3) a mix of both. I
                                        continued to engage in the collaborative discussion.

                                        was the interviews conducted would be informal and unstructured. I completed a
                                        formative activity on a <a href="#caseStudyPrivacy">case study on privacy</a>.

                                        In this unit we were introduced to interviews and surveys. To gain knowledge and
                                        insights, I engaged on the required reading material (Berenson et al., 2015;
                                        Dawson, 2015; Confessore, 2018). As part of this unit, there was a formative
                                        submission on a case study on inappropriate use of surveys. My submission can be

                                        Unit 06 was about understanding questionnaire. This unit helped me understand
                                        the difference between surveys and questionnaires and how to use them during
                                        research. Surveys are used for data collection while questionnaires are a set of
                                        questions for someone to answer which would help understand their perspective of
                                        a topic (Question Pro, 2021).

                                        In Unit 07, I learnt how important it is to ensure that the findings of the
                                        research are and can be generalised. In this unit, the first summative
                                        submission was due. While working on the literature review, I tried to implement
                                        on generalixxxsing my findings to have an overview of the research topic while
                                        keeping it focussed to the research topic. Additionally, we started a new
                                        collaboration topic- Accuracy of information.

                                        In unit 08, I learnt inferential statistics where I learnt how to analyse set of
                                        data by learning the probability of dealing with uncertainty. Through the
                                        worksheet, I learnt how to hypotheses to analyse the data.

                                        This unit was similar to the previous unit. In this unit, I was able to analyse
                                        the data in charts. Charts are graphically easier to interpret and analyse the
                                        data provided. During this unit, I was able to demonstrate the ability to
                                        present the data in charts using Excel as the software. It was a great exercise
                                        to refresh myself on the charts.

                                        In this unit, we focused on research writing to prepare for the final
                                        decertation. This unit had a summative deadline of the research presentation. My
                                        reflection on this summative can be found within the module reflection. The unit
                                        also had a formative submission to complete which was the statistical worksheet
                                        from the previous 2 units. My submission and feedback can be found in the

                                        Unit 11 was about professional development and looking towards the e-portfolio.
                                        In this unit, I reflected upon my academic and professional career thus far
                                        through a SWOT analysis, skills matrix, and an action plan. This can be found in

                                        Unit 12 provided me with useful information such as the aspects of project
                                        management (Maylor, 2010) and risk management (Marichetty, 2017). I found this
                                        useful as I was able to learn about the concepts of risk management in IT
                                        (McManus, 2012) which I can implement un my career going forward

                                During the last twelve weeks, I learnt about Research Methods and Professional Practice.
                                This module covered the various aspects ranging from tools and techniques that would be
                                used as a researcher.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I this module, there were different activities on a weekly basis that I was able to
                                contribute such as the collaborative discussions, formative submissions, and compulsory
                                e-portfolio activities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The collaborative discussion topics were interesting and in particular I found the
                                collaborative discussion about Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct interesting than
                                the case study- Accuracy of Information. Prior to this module, I had the interpretation
                                that code of ethics is a certain method to perform a task in the correct manner. The
                                collaboration forum allowed me to broaden my knowledge by analysing a case study and
                                with further reading I understood that there are different aspects to consider such as
                                the legal and social issues. Additionally, there are two types of ethics to consider,
                                and these are (1) Compliance Based and (2) Value based (HAYES, 2023).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I felt that this module was well structured in relation to the final decertation where
                                various concepts learnt in this module can potentially help and guide me through the
                                decertation. Some of the topics that I felt are relevant towards the decertation are (1)
                                Understanding the types of reasoning (MIESSLER, 2018), (2) the different research
                                designs (Question Pro, 2021) and (3) Questionnaire design to use to collect primary data
                                of the research topic (Question Pro, 2020).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Working on the various formative submissions throughout the module, helped me build upon
                                my criticality skills and to be able to critique various literature which helped me on
                                my literature review.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The literature review summative was a great preparation for my final decertation as this
                                gives me a rough idea on the expectations for the decertation. While working on the
                                literature review, I understood the importance of having a brief outline to help in
                                guiding through the relevant key points required within the literature review.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The feedback received from the tutor was informative and positive. From the feedback
                                received, I felt that I could have done better in some areas such as reading more
                                publications relevant towards the topic to potentially increase the criticality and as a
                                result, there would be a debate within the literature. Additionally, I should mix up the
                                citations instead of focussing on a particular author before going to the next. By
                                mixing up the authors, I would be able to draw different opinions and build a debate.
                                This was informative feedback as I can keep the points of improvement and use them for
                                the final decertation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The presentation summative, I found that it provides a method to share your topic in a
                                summary with key important factors that you would want to share prior to the research
                                along the methodology and timelines of the research. This provides a mode of
                                communication to present to others and this can be applied in the real world by
                                presenting to potential clients on a particular presentation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The feedback shared by the tutor for the research presentation was informative with some
                                great pointes to improve on. One of the pointers mentioned was for me to ensure that I
                                need to work on the pace of the presentation to allow in depth analysis within a short
                                period of time. Another area of improvement was for me to add more slides to the
                                presentation as some areas during the presentation were too long and ensure to keep the
                                audience in mind while presenting to ensure there is engagement during the presentation.
                                These pointers do provide great areas to improve on for the future and can be applied in
                                the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As part of the formative submissions was a statistical analysis where I was tasked to
                                analyse set of statistics on an Excel workbook using Hypothesis and Bar Charts. I found
                                analysing the data with bar charts easier compared to the hypothesis method as visuals
                                are easier to interpret. I ensured that I was able to critically analyse the data and
                                support my reasoning with the relevant references.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From the feedback received from the tutor, I was pleased with the feedback as I felt I
                                did a great job critically analysing the data provided.
                            </p>

                                The professional skills matrix provides an overview of the various skills I am
                                proficient and skills that I need to improve on. I feel this does benefit me as it gives
                                an overview of the key skills required. This shoed me that I am proficient in areas such
                                as teamwork and areas I need to build on such as commercial awareness.
                            </p>

                                I feel I lack commercial awareness in Cyber Security as I have changed my career path
                                from physical security to Cyber Security. Prior to the slight change of career path, I
                                was aware of the latest technology in relation to physical security. With Cyber
                                Security, it is an evolving industry and new tools, technology, it is difficult to keep
                                up on a regular basis however it is important to, and I plan on working towards keeping
                                up with the current tools of the industry.

                                This module provided me with great insights on ways to conduct research that will be
                                useful going forward in my career and the final decertation of my master’s degree.
