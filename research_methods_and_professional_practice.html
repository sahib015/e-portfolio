                                        I have chosen to review the case, <a
                                            href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-dark-ux-patterns/">Dark

                                        for a UX designer it helps in designing a user-friendly interfacethat can be
                                        easily navigable by the end user.

                                        Dark user experience patterns are carefully designed to trick users into doing
                                        things without an understanding of human psychology. This raises a question-
                                        what is the user being tricked to do and with
                                        what motivation? The dark patterns were categorised to represent subversion of
                                        user centred design principles while some of these behaviours was a result of
                                        poor designs (Gray, et al., 2018).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The situation raises important questions related to the legal and social issues,
                                        as well as the professionalism of the UX designers in this case study. One of
                                        the legal issues in this case study is to
                                        deliberately mislead information or to discriminate against those with
                                        disabilities. This is where ethics come in and why it is vital for the UX
                                        designers to practice best practices and ensure all different
                                        types of users are catered for while designing the user interface for the end
                                        user. This has violated the BCS code of conduct section 1c which prohibits any
                                        discrimination with disabilities.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While this may have not been intentional, the policies and procedures should
                                        have been adhered to ensuring that their clients' designs are not deceptive or
                                        harmful to its users. Unfortunately, the outcome
                                        was such that there was a breach of ethics code principles as well as the BCS
                                        code of conduct.

                                            <p>
                                                thanks for the opportunity to review this case with you. I find it
                                                intriguing that this kind of practices is still happening. What makes me
                                                curious is if people who employ such tactics do get fined or imprisoned
                                                or punished in any way defined by the relevant law. For example, Mark
                                                Zuckerberg has "his own" dark UX pattern named after him (UXPin, 2023).
                                                It does appear however, that he was never personally held accountable,
                                                in any meaningful way, for the wrongdoing of Facebook (Goodwin, B. et
                                                al., 2019).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It is great, however, to see the actions of government bodies, such as
                                                Federal Trade Commission in the US, which acknowledge how harmful this
                                                practice is and implement fines, investigations and other efforts in
                                                order to limi dar UX patterns occurring (Ritchie et al., 2022).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Lastly, thank you very much for sharing the study on the dark UX
                                                patterns (Gray et al., 2018) which I found interesting to read. I wonder
                                                if you have any examples from your life that come to mind, where you
                                                experienced some of the dark UX design patterns?
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                For me it was a Polish website similar to Amazon (in function,
                                                definitely not in scale) called Allegro.pl (Allegro.pl). They have
                                                changed this right now, so I am unable to prove or to reference any
                                                source, but I remember from my personal experience, when they would ask
                                                to join their membership club for a fee. In the pop-up window there was
                                                no yes/no option, but either "Yes I want to join" or "No, I want to miss
                                                on a great deal" option. This particular pattern appears to use the
                                                cognitive dissonance theory, which quite clearly states, that if we want
                                                to take an action (click the "[...] miss on a great deal" button) that
                                                is conflicting with our believes (I surely do not want to miss on great
                                                deals, I just do not find this one to be a great one), it puts a strain
                                                on our nervous system (Harmon-Jones, E. et al., 2019).

                                                The usage of dark UX Patterns for manipulation, may be just an evolution
                                                of selling behaviour, that was previously seen in traditional
                                                brick-and-mortar stores personally.
                                                Examples would be where the Cashier desks are positioned at the back of
                                                the store, so you need to walk past most of the store to pay for any
                                                items you want to purchase, or the layout of Ikea Home furnishing Stores
                                                in Europe, where they would like you to follow the arrows around the
                                                complete store, regardless of what you are looking to purchase, or even
                                                “3 for 2” on some items, to fool you into thinking that the shop is
                                                cheaper, but other goods are more expensive than the competitors to even
                                                out the “offers”.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                A study (Alawadhi et al, 2016) confirms that store layout and a
                                                perception of it being busy or crowded, help to reinforce to the shopper
                                                that it must be worth the effort to shop there. This modelling shows
                                                that manipulation as part of the buying experience is nothing new.
                                                Perhaps people in general, are far more easily manipulated than we would
                                                like to think.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The recent increase in online shopping practices changes the game a bit
                                                though.
                                                From an online shopping site perspective, and using an understanding of
                                                human psychology, a web page is designed to appeal more through whatever
                                                means – colours, shapes, Lay-out, etc, in order to try and convince the
                                                shopper to purchase more of the items.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The same practices used in real shops, are copied online, but with much
                                                more simplicity.
                                                Gray states (Gray et al, 2021) “We also rely upon recent work that
                                                describes the role of crafty psychological nudging through the
                                                incorporation of “dark patterns” and instances where coercion is
                                                blatantly described in ways that often force users to make decisions
                                                against their own best interest—what Gray and colleagues describe as
                                                “asshole designs””.Ì
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                What is also interesting in their study, is that their results show that
                                                a very high percentage of users (over 80%) mistrust smartphone
                                                applications or websites, at least some of the time, and not just
                                                related to shopping experiences.
                                                This “non-default-trust” perception is not surprising, as I am sure we
                                                have all seen websites with offers for things that just seem to be too
                                                good to be true.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I think your conclusion is very interesting, as the usage of dark UX can
                                                certainly be called dishonest or unethical, and it certainly breaks a
                                                number of the BCS principles along the way.
                                                I think that it could be difficult however, to easily change the laws to
                                                prevent this, though the EU-GDPR is going some way to try and address
                                                this for member states, and have published “guidelines” to web designers
                                                as well as users, to be able to recognise and avoid using Dark UX
                                                patterns (EDPB, 2022).

                                                The post and summary provide a good overview of dark UX patterns and the
                                                legal and ethical issues surrounding them. You have correctly identified
                                                that dark UX patterns are designed to trick users into doing things they
                                                would not otherwise do, and that they can have a negative impact on
                                                users, including those with disabilities.

                                                You also raised important questions about the professionalism of UX
                                                designers who use dark UX patterns. UX designers have a responsibility
                                                to design user interfaces that are ethical and accessible to all users.
                                                The use of dark UX patterns violates this responsibility and can damage
                                                the reputation of the UX designer and their employer. (bcs.org, 2022)

                                                You concluded by stating that the policies and procedures of the UX
                                                designers in the case study should have been adhered to in order to
                                                ensure that their clients' designs were not deceptive or harmful to
                                                users. Unfortunately, this was not done, and as a result, there was a
                                                breach of ethics code principles as well as the BCS code of conduct. I
                                                would like to ask what are the challenges of avoiding dark UX patterns
                                                for developers.

                                                raised important questions about the professionalism of UX designers who

                                                    It is indeed disappointing to see this kind of behaviour in
                                                    workplaces be a problem and damaging impact on the organisation.

                                                    With the moral of Diane being negatively impacted along with a toxic
                                                    working environment as mentioned in your post, I would like to add
                                                    on the social impact where employees like Diane would feel low in
                                                    confidence and their level of productivity decreases such as
                                                    procrastinating, taking longer breaks or leaving their workplace
                                                    early (Ahmad & Omar, 2013).
                                                    While Max’s behaviour clearly violated several principles outlined
                                                    in your post, his power was indeed an abuse of power being the team
                                                    leader. I feel that despite being a team leader, it is important to
                                                    consider and appreciate your team’s efforts and acknowledge the team
                                                    member's contribution instead of authorship. Appreciating and
                                                    acknowledging the team’s effort boosts the morale of the team and
                                                    motivates them to perform better and impact the organisation
                                                    positively.

                                                    Considering that Corazon has worked with charities providing
                                                    healthcare services for individuals below the poverty line to ensure
                                                    that they have access to healthcare. It has indeed impacted society
                                                    in a positive manner that can be used as motivation for other
                                                    healthcare organisations and Corazon to continue making a difference
                                                    in society.

                                                    As Corazon continues to grow, it would be interesting to see how it
                                                    would ensure the protection of patient records is kept secure. I

                                    Thanks for the review comments on my initial post.

                                    A study was conducted on the Facebook interface over the years. For instance, the
                                    “Logout Button” was at the top of the navigation bar, and since 2010, the position
                                    of the logout button moved to the accounts section. (Mildner & Savino, 2021). UX
                                    designs are meant to allow the end user to navigate through the interface with ease
                                    and should generally be self-intuitive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, Facebook introduced a feature called “Privacy check-up (Mildner &
                                    Savino, 2021) that allows users to edit their privacy settings according to their
                                    preferences. As part of the dark UX patterns, the complete range of settings is not
                                    available, and this is where the user is being tricked as I mentioned in my initial
                                    post dark user experience patterns are carefully designed to trick users. This plays
                                    in the mind of the user that the complete range of settings are available however,
                                    unknowingly Facebook is holding some privacy settings that are not visible to the
                                    user and therefore the users are unaware of them. This would therefore be considered
                                    unethical and against the BCS code of conduct and ACM code of ethics.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In my opinion, the challenges I foresee a developer may have on how to develop
                                    within the code of ethics is omitting any hidden costs during an online checkout or
                                    ensuring that the correct link is displayed when clicked instead of a different
                                    action being performed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In summary, it is important that as a user interface designer to ensure that the
                                    users are not being tricked and are considering the code of ethics while developing
                                    the user interfaces of the software.

                                Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received
                                a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz.
                                Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses
                                and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi
                                has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they
                                may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz
                                in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support
                                either side of any issue.”

                                <li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically.
                                    But is
                                    it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports
                                    two
                                    or more different conclusions?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?

                                <li>
                                    If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that
                                    they
                                    will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?
                                </li>

                            </ol>

                                <p>
                                    Having collected the necessary data, Abi should not manipulate the data to support a
                                    biased conclusion as this would be considered fraud. If Abi shares his findings that
                                    are biased and focuses on his conclusion of the analysis in a particular direction
                                    while omitting important information is unethical as this can mislead the buyer of
                                    the cereal (The National Academies Press, 2009).

                                    Statistics during an analysis have an impact on the analysis when appropriately
                                    used. According to (Grilli, et al., 2023), there are tools and techniques for
                                    handling data that would allow data professionals like Abi to extract necessary
                                    information to provide insights. However, when statistics are used inappropriately,
                                    results can be tampered with leaving important information and misleading the buyer.
                                    Therefore, it is important that Abi is transparent and unbiased as this would ensure
                                    he completes the analysis ethically.

                                    AAccording to (Simundic, 2013) it is dishonest and unethical to conduct biased
                                    research, and therefore, Abi should include the ethical concerns he has in his
                                    analysis.

                                                Thanks for your entry. Do you have some examples of a local legislation
                                                which would indicate the kind of penalties for committing mentioned
                                                fraud? It would be interesting to learn a bit more about that.

                                                Your point about statistics having an impact on the analysis is very
                                                accurate.
                                                False use of statistics could be potentially damaging to the consumer in
                                                this case, as the cereal would potentially be marketed as a healthy
                                                option, but the truth may in fact be something different.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                The statistics could be used as part of an advertising campaign, but it
                                                would essentially be using false and misleading information, if not all
                                                known factors are considered. It has been shown (Madhavi, 2020) that
                                                “misleading and false advertisements have had an impact on consumer
                                                behavior”.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Whilst in some cases this may be just unethical, in situations like the
                                                one with Whizzz Cereal, it could have potentially long lasting health
                                                implications for the consumer.

                                                Thank you Piotor for your response. In regard to the legislation that is
                                                punishable for committing any kind of fraud. In Abi’s case, it is
                                                manipulation of data. Under the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act 2018
                                                in Kenya, section 26, it is punishable by law for any fraudulent or
                                                dishonest intent is an offense and is liable to a fine not exceeding Ksh
                                                20,000,000/- (approx. £104,920.78) or a term in prison not exceeding 10

                                                I agree with you that Abi is entirely responsible for conducting the
                                                research and is held responsible. Additionally, defining the methodology
                                                in advance as early as the initial stages of the research can provide a
                                                clear layout of the research.

                                                In your initial post, you mentioned that Abi would face several ethical
                                                dilemmas. I would like to add to that with a couple of ethical concerns.

                                                Hi Pearce,

                                            <p>
                                                In your post, you mentioned that nutritional research is an issue with
                                                companies promoting false claims. It is important for Abi to be aware of
                                                and account for numerous food-related issues when collecting data such
                                                as the different varieties Whizz may have. Another factor that Abi would
                                                need to consider is people's BMI, food preferences, metabolic rate, and
                                                fitness levels, among others (Vitolins & Case, 2020). While gathering
                                                the relevant data it is important that Abi maintains ethical integrity
                                                and confidentiality ensuring the data is as accurate as possible.

                            During the last twelve weeks, I learnt about security and risk management. This module
                            covered various aspects about the security and risks that affect the
                            IT industry and possible wates of mitigating the risks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this module there were different activities that I was able to contribute in as part of a
                            group and individually, such as the collaboration discussions, seminar activities,
                            eportfolio
                            activities and being able to work in a group for the assessments. The collaboration
                            discussion topics were interesting and in particular I found the collaborative discission
                            about CVSS
                            more interesting than Industry 4.0. Prior to this module, I had only come across CVSS being
                            a rating of a security threat. While contributing to the discussion forum, it broadened my
                            knowledge regarding CVSS. While reading other colleagues posts in the forum, it made me
                            understand that CVSS is not the only scoring method and additionally there are different
                            factors
                            to consider making it an unreliable source. The factors that make me feel that CVSS is an
                            unreliable scoring criterion are (1) the CVSS formula, (2) there is no evidence that the
                            formula
                            is robust, (3) the CVSS formula is not transparent about how the formula is derived and (4)
                            the skill set of the individual scoring the vulnerability. With these factors in
                            consideration,
                            I think CVSS is more of a qualitative risk method instead of a quantitative risk method.

                            Working in a group for the assessment was an interesting experience as this allowed me to
                            work with other colleagues in the course. While working on the assessments with my
                            colleagues in
                            different backgrounds, help me learn from them and gain some of their knowledge. As I am
                            currently not working in an organisation and in at my previous workplace, the organisation’s
                            main
                            focus is on physical security, and I had the basic understanding of the different security
                            threats from my bachelor’s degree. I learnt from them and would hopefully use what I learnt
                            from
                            them and during the course in the coming future.

                            The assessments of the module were challenging and interesting at the same time. With an
                            organisation working to digitalise their business and begin the digitalisation process,
                            there are different
                            factors to consider which was outline as part of the requirements. I found the assessment an
                            exciting challenge ahead as to evaluate the potential security risks of the organisation may
                            have as a
                            group while digitalising their business and what aspects to consider during the
                            digitalisation, such as the importance of having business continuity and a disaster recovery
                            plan for any possible
                            disruptions that may occur.

                            One of the instances while working as a group, we had a challenge in creating the analytical
                            hierarchal process (AHP) for the assessment. As for a consistent AHP, the consistency ratio
                            must be less
                            than 0.1 however we were getting a consistency ratio of greater than 0.1. At this stage, we
                            were confused whether we got the calculations wrong and after further research, according to
                            (Business
                            Performance, 2019), we realised that it is okay to have the consistency ratio greater than
                            0.1. This meant that there could be inconsistency in the supply chain making room for areas
                            to improve the
                            consistency of a supply chain.

                            As mentioned earlier, there were several tasks within this module that had individual
                            activities. There was an individual activity regarding Monte Carlo simulation that had some
                            exercises in excel.
                            During this activity, there was some confusion I had on a particular question that was
                            slightly misleading and contacted my tutor for assistance. With the discussion I had with
                            the tutor, I was able
                            to understand the scenario and clear the confusion I had, I was able to complete the
                            activity. This can be found in the section <a href="#risk_modelling">Risk Modelling
                                Activities </a>

                        <p>
                            In general, this module was very interesting and educative for me. At my previous workplace
                            before I left the organisation, the organisation had a ransomware attack, and I was unable
                            to mitigate
                            this from happening due to the lack of knowledge and expertise despite working with another
                            colleague managing the IT infrastructure of the organisation. At the time of the ransomware
                            attack,
                            there was no disaster recovery plan nor business continuity in place for such incidents
                            apart from a data back-up that was not recent as it was about 2 months old. This module made
                            me understand
                            the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery plan for any organisation. As a
                            result, the organisation had lost its data of about 2 months and the time it took to recover
                            from the
                            ransomware attack with a poor recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective
                            (RTO).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reflecting back to the time the organisation had the ransomware attack after this module, I
                            have learnt that it is important to perform regular checks on policies, ensuring all
                            standard regulations
                            are in place. Had I known how important business continuity and disaster recovery plan is,
                            continuous risk analysis and performing security system checks, I would have been in a
                            position to advise
                            the head of the IT department on the implementation process of a disaster recovery plan.
                            After this module, it has not only educated me on the security risks and ways to manage them
                            but also the
                            importance to educate others to create awareness on the potential security risks they may
                            have as an organisation or as an individual. By creating awareness, this educates others who
                            are unaware of
                            the risks and how they could potentially reduce the security risks that they may encounter
                            in the future in the digital world.
